    <h2>Culture
  </h2>
    <h3>Literature</h3><br>
      <p>The earliest works of Indian literature were orally  transmitted. The Rig Veda, a collection of sacred hymns (1500–1200 BCE), and  epics Ramayana and Mahabharata composed towards the end of the first millennium  BCE, form a part of India&rsquo;s impressive repository of literary works.Examples of  Classical Sanskrit literature include Shakuntala and Meghaduuta, two plays  written by Kalidas,indisputable India&rsquo;s greatest playwright in  Sanskrit;Mricchakatika by Shudraka;SvapnaVasavadattam by Bhasa, and Ratnavali  by Sri Harsha. Later poetic works include GeetaGovinda by Jayadeva, as well  asChanakya'sArthashastra and Vatsyayana'sKamasutra.<br>
  <br>
      In the medieval period, Kannada and Telugu literature gained ascendency in the  9th and 11th centuries, followed by works in Marathi, Bengali, and various  dialects of Hindi, Persian and Urdu. Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore became  India's first Nobel Laureateliterature in early 20th century.</p><br><figure class="centered"><img src="understanding-india-literature.jpg" width="200" height="170" alt=""/>

      <h3>Music</h3><br>
      <p>Said to be one of the oldest unbroken musical traditions  in the world, Indian classical music has its originsin the Vedas (ancient  scriptures of the Hindus). Over the centuries, Indian classical music has also  evolved through interaction between different races and cultures. <br>
  <br>
      The foundation of Indian music is &lsquo;sangeet,&rsquo; a combination of three artforms:  vocal music, instrumental music and dance. Although these three artforms were  originally derived from stagecraft, today they represent different, highly  complex individual artforms.<br>
  <br>
      The system of Indian music is based onraag and taal with the former being the  melodic form and the latter the rhythmic.<br>
  <br>
      Raagcan be roughly equated with the Western term mode or scale.&nbsp; There is  a system of seven notes which are arranged similar to Western scales.&nbsp; The  taals are complex and revolve around repeating patterns of beats.<br>
      The different interpretations of the raag and the taalhas led to the  distinction of two major traditions of classical music:&nbsp; Hindustani  sangeetof the north and Carnatic sangeet of the south. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
      Instruments typically used in Hindustani music include the sitar, sarod,  surbahar, tanpura, bansuri, shehnai, sarangi, santoor, pakhavaj and tabla. Instruments  typically used in Carnatic music include venu, gottuvadyam, harmonium, veena,  mridangam, kanjira, ghatam and violin.</p><br><figure class="centered"><img src="understanding-india-music.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt=""/>

      <h3>Cinema</h3><br>
      <p>India is the world's largest producer of films, with as  many as 1,000 films in various languages of India being produced annually.  India&rsquo;s first full-length motion picture,Raja Harishchandra (1913), a silent  film in Marathi,was produced by DadasahebPhalke. ArdeshirIrani released  AlamAra, the first Indian talking film, on 14 March 1931 and H.M. Reddy,  produced and directed BhaktaPrahlada (Telugu), released on 15 September 15,  1931 and Kalidas (Tamil) released on 31 October&nbsp; 31, 1931.<br>
  <br>
      The 'Golden Age' of Indian cinema -- the late 1940s to the 1960s – saw the  production of some of the most critically acclaimed Indian films of all time,  such as&nbsp; Guru Dutt&rsquo;s films Pyaasa (1957) and KaagazKePhool (1959) and Raj  Kapoor films Awaara (1951) and Shree 420 (1955). These films expressed social  themes mainly dealing with working-class urban life in India post independence.<br>
  <br>
      Simultaneously, the Parallel Cinema movement, mainly led by Bengali cinema,  emerged. Early examples of films in this movement include ChetanAnand'sNeecha  Nagar (1946),[RitwikGhatak'sNagarik (1952), and Bimal Roy's Do BeeghaZameen  (1953), laying the foundations for Indian neorealism and the &quot;Indian New  Wave&quot;. Satyajit Ray&rsquo;s The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959) won major prizes at all  the major international film festivals and led to the 'Parallel Cinema'  movement being firmly established in Indian cinema. Ever since ChetanAnand's  social realist film Neecha Nagar won the Grand Prize at the first Cannes Film  Festival, Indian films frequently competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes  Film Festival for nearly every year in the 1950s and early 1960s, with a number  of them winning major prizes at the festival. Satyajit Ray also won the Golden  Lion at the Venice Film Festival for Aparajito (1956), the second part of The  Apu Trilogy, and the Golden Bear and two Silver Bears for Best Director at the  Berlin International Film Festival. A number of Indian films from different  regions, from this era are often included among the greatest films of all time  in various critics' and directors' polls</p><figure class="centered"><img src="understanding-india-cinema.jpg" width="200" height="170" alt=""/>
