    <h3>Independence</h3>
   <p>  India wrested its independence from Britain in 1947 after  a long freedom struggle led largely by the Indian National Congress and its  visionary leaders, especially, Mahatma Gandhi. From 1920, the freedom movement  leaders began highly popular mass campaign against the British Raj using  largely peaceful methods. India&rsquo;s acquisition of independence resulted in the  formation of two countries, India and Pakistan. Following the controversial  partition of India, rioting broke out, leaving some 500,000 dead. Also, this  period saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history,  with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly  created nations of India and Pakistan.</p>

   <h3>Colonial<br>
    </h3>
   <p> The Europeans -- Portuguese, French, Dutch, Danish and  British -- started arriving in the early 1600s after Vasco da Gama successfully  discovered a new sea route from Europe to India in 1498. All of them held  territories in India and made friends and enemies among India's rulers as they  got more and more involved with Indian politics, but it was the British who  eventually controlled most of India and finally made it one of their colonies.  In 1617, the British East India Company was given permission by Mughal Emperor  Jahangir to trade in India. In the aftermath of India&rsquo;s First War of  Independence in 1857, all power was transferred from the East India Company to  the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as a colony; the  company's lands were controlled directly and the rest through the rulers of  what it called the Princely states.</p>

    <h3>Mughal</h3><br>
       <p>The Mughals came from Central Asia and soon held sway  over most of the northern parts of the subcontinent. Mughal rulers introduced  Central Asian art and architecture to India. In addition to the Mughals and  various Rajput kingdoms, several independent Hindu states, such as the  Vijayanagara Empire, the Maratha Empire, and the Ahom Kingdom, flourished  simultaneously in southern, western, and north-eastern India, respectively. The  Mughal Empire suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which  provided opportunities for the Afghans, Balochis, Sikhs, and Marathas to  exercise control over large areas in the northwest of the subcontinent until  the British East India Company gained ascendancy over South Asia.</p><figure class="centered"><img src="mughal.jpg" width="200" height="170" alt=""/>
